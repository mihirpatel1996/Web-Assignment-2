## Design of Webpages
There are four web pages selected to design in this assignment.

1.Home page
2.Log In page
3.Contact Us page
4.Product page

All the web pages are responsive in design to provide better UI for all different sizes of devices.
In the application there are few colors which are used frequently in design to maintain consistency throughout design.
All of the Web pages maintain similar design in all the web pages to maintain familiarity while using.

### colors
Colors in the application used are combination of light and dark colors to differentiate different components of application.

There are only few colors mainly used in all the web pages which are black, green and red.
Black color is used in navigation bar across four pages because the color stands out at first glance to any web page. Navbar with black color is instantly recognizable and it has most used feature of any website.
White color is used for fonts in navigation bar to easily regonize links.
Green color is used in other elements of design as application is for branding and selling plants and accessories online.
Other reason to use green in design is to give contrast to the navigation bar design.

### Home Page
Home page is the landing page of the application which comprises different components like navigation bar, and a carousel.
Carousel is used to make home page more interactive with user and not overload them with all different sortts of products.
Sign in page link is at the end of the navbar at right end because it is immediately recognized by any user.
Logo of the application also directs to the home page.
Links which are most important for a user are available at first glance to user in navigation bar.
Plants, Accessories, Pots, Plant care and Contact Us links are provided to user in navigation bar.

Product page has navigation bar at the top, product description below it and comments are at the end of the web page.
All product related details are provided in product page.
