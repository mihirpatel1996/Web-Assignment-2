All the web pages are responsive in design to provide better UI for all different sizes of devices.
In the application there are few colors which are used frequently in design to maintain consistency throughout design.
All of the Web pages maintain similar design to maintain familiarity while using.


### colors
Colors in the application used are combination of light and dark colors to differentiate different components of application.

Colors mainly used in all the web pages which are black, blue and red.
Black color is used in navigation bar across four pages because the color stands out at first glance in any web page. Navbar with black color is instantly recognizable and it has most used feature of any website.
White color is used for fonts in navigation bar to easily regonize links.
Blue color is used in other elements of design, reason is to give contrast to the navigation bar design.
